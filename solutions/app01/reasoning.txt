1/
 - Long run queue
 - High ratio CPU system/user
=> threads contention
-> remove (useless) synchronized blocks

2/ Still same kind of observations
=> same conclusion
-> increase thread pool size from 5 to 200

3/  Memory leak + we are very close to OoM error when running for a longer time than 5 min
    (cf. GC log)
-> Remove history stack
